// worker.js
// The whole server. Read it before you deploy it.
//
// Cloudflare calls fetch() with every request that reaches the workers.dev URL
// and sends back whatever Response is returned.
//
// Four things to recognize here:
//   env.DB      the D1 binding from wrangler.toml (no connection string, nothing to leak)
//   bind(?)     the user's value goes in as a parameter, never pasted into the SQL
//   status 400  the EARS "unwanted behavior" row, executable
//   CORS        headers telling the browser this page is allowed to call this Worker

// The origins this page is actually served from. Narrowed from the Session B
// wildcard, which let any website in the world call this Worker from a visitor's
// browser using that visitor's network position.
//
// What this does NOT fix, and it matters: CORS is a rule browsers enforce on
// pages. It is not access control. Anyone with curl can still read, write, and
// delete every entry here, because there is no authentication at all. That is
// consequence 2 in ADR-002 and it is ADR-003's problem. Narrowing CORS is worth
// doing and is not the fix; recording that distinction is the point.
//
// If the Codespace is recreated its hostname changes and the first entry below
// must be updated, or the page will load and every request will be blocked.
